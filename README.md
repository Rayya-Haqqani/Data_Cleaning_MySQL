This MySQL data cleaning process is done to prepare a dataset for analysis while ensuring the integrity and quality of the data. 

The key steps involved are as follows:
- **Creating a Staging Table**: A staging table is established to store the cleaned data, allowing access to the original raw data if needed.

- **Removing Duplicates**: Duplicate records are identified and eliminated to ensure each entry in the dataset is unique.

- **Standardizing the Data**: Data is standardized by converting text to a consistent format, such as making all entries lowercase and trimming excess spaces.

- **Removing NULL Values or Blank Spaces**: Rows containing `NULL` values or blank spaces are removed to maintain data integrity.

- **Removing Unnecessary Rows or Columns**: Any rows or columns that do not contribute to the analysis are deleted, simplifying the dataset for more effective analysis.
